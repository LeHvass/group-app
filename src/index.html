        <h3>Dream Job</h3>
        <p>The frontend side of things interests me less and less as time goes by, therefore I think that in 10 years I
          will be working with backend and databases, and less on
          the looks.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>My favorite subject in school has always been math. In high school i got a 12 in Math A and have always
          liked the problem solving and logical thinking side of it.
          Which is why the development path felt natural to me.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Many in my family have always worked within the IT-industry, which has probably affected me a bit. I started
          marking HTML-websites in a relatively early age, where especially the coding and design was interesting - but
          over time I got a little off it again. In 2015 I then chose to start on Multimediadesign, followed up by a
          top-up
          where I am now.</p>

        <h3>Dream Job</h3>
        <p>I'm developing cool stuff at a big company or I've developed my own successful application.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Since my early teenage years I've had an interest for design, which led me to the MMD 2 years ago. At MMD I was introduced to code, which I always thought wasn't for me, but I discovered how fun It was and how much I enjoyed it better than doing design. This is the reason why I'm here on the Web Dev.</p>

        <h3>Dream Job</h3>
        <p>I will either be working as an architect or senior full-stack developer at an agency or software company. As

          also dream of pursuing life as a freelancer, perhaps I'll be working as a consultant or working with my own
          product(s).</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>My first contact with development was during high school in the subject "Communication & IT".
          Following that, I developed a PHP/MySQL-based personal management dashboard which included a calendar, to do
          list / homework manager & a habit tracker.</p>
